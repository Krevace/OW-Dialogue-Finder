		<Text>SECCA: To any who come here searching for us: We followed one of the two beacons from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]> to this place, but now can go no further.

			SECCA: It’s almost too faint to hear now, but the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>’s beacon is still faintly emitting from within this thorny seed. Yet the opening is too small for even a single Nomai to fit through it, so our <![CDATA[<color=orange>escape pod</color>]]> couldn’t have flown through here.

			SECCA: I don’t understand how this could be possible, but this gruesome place seems able to manipulate space itself; maybe this was our undoing.

		<Text>
			SECCA: To be so close to the location of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]> and still so far is... difficult. Worse, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>’s beacon is dying; soon, we will be unable to hear it.

		<Text>
			SECCA: There is nothing we can do now but try to perhaps find a way inside, or at least attempt to comprehend why this happened.

		<Text>
			SECCA: My dearest hope is that the other escape pods were able to reach relative safety.
