			Melorae: Coleus is missing! He vanished from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Lakebed Cave</color>]]> (the one at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the north pole) several days ago, and we’re unable to find any trace of him. I don’t know how much air he had when he disappeared. I beg any friend reading this, help us recover Coleus!
