    <Text>SOLANUM: There is fundamental uncertainty throughout the universe. Normally, this uncertainty is only observable on a very small scale. As one approaches the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]>, however, that uncertainty grows <![CDATA[<i>enormously</i>]]>.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: The <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]> probably exhibits macroscopic quantum behavior because of its proximity to the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]>. Shards that broke off from the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]> have a similar effect, as I imagine you’ve seen elsewhere in this star system.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: Conscious observation forces a quantum object to collapse to a single possibility. But what would happen if a conscious observer somehow entered the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]> itself?</Text>
