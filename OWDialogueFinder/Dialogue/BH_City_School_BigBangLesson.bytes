			SOLANUM: No one knows how this universe was made, but one thing we do know is everything used to be very hot and very dense (tightly packed together).

		<Text>
			SOLANUM: As this early universe expanded, it also cooled down. Once it had cooled down enough, particles were able to group together to form things like galaxies, stars, and planets!
