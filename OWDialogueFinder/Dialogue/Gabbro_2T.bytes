			<Page>Okay, here’s a weird one for you — I think I might have just, like, died? Somehow?</Page>
			<Page>I radioed Hornfels at the observatory to ask them about it, but they’re convinced I fell asleep out here and had a nightmare something.</Page>
			<Page>Do you remember, y’know, dying a few minutes ago? Maybe?</Page>

			<Page>Okay, cool, that’s what I thought. It was all way too vivid to be a dream.</Page>
			<Page>I radioed Hornfels again to ask if they had died, too, but I’m pretty sure they thought I was being metaphorical.</Page>

			<Page>Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn’t just fall asleep and have a weird dream or something. But stars above, what’s going on, then? And then there was that thing with the Nomai statue earlier...</Page>
			<Page>Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I’m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like the time with that statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?</Page>
			<Page>So... we died, but we aren’t dead? That’s pretty unusual for Hearthians.</Page>
			<Page>I am going to need to do some serious thinking before I come up with any theories. Maybe I’ll have figured something out by the next time you come by.</Page>

			<Page>Well, what are any of us doing here, really?</Page>
			<Page>...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.</Page>
			<Page>But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.</Page>
			<Page>I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.</Page>

			<Page>Well actually, after waking up from, you know, dying, I saw the same bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.</Page>
			<Page>What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the <![CDATA[<i>island</i>]]> where I found the glowing Nomai <![CDATA[<i>statue</i>]]>.<![CDATA[<Pause>]]> ...Get it?</Page>
			<Page>I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.</Page>
			<Page>If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.</Page>

			<Page>Haha, I know, right?</Page>
			<Page>...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.</Page>
			<Page>There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.</Page>
			<Page>As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.</Page>
			<Page>You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip - if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.</Page>

			<Page>That’s a good question.</Page>

			<Page>Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol’ Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn’t find a single thing wrong with it.</Page>
			<Page>Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it.</Page>
			<Page>I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol’ Spacey is to use a map that’s generated by the satellite itself, isn’t it? Like it’s inviting us to visit. Good ol’ deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we’re going.</Page>

			<Page>Dunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there’s signal interference and I can’t hear them.</Page>
			<Page>Best guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like… what’s considered “weird” for a satellite, you know?</Page>
			<Page>Anyway, if you ever want to visit Ol’ Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body.</Page>

			<Page>I mean, the satellite’s not <![CDATA[<i>]]>super<![CDATA[</i>]]> old, but it’s hardly brand-new. “Ol’” is more a term of affection. ...You’re being very literal-minded about this.</Page>
			<Page>Ol’ Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body.</Page>

			<Page>Yeah, um, the one that’s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? …That map?</Page>
			<Page>You didn’t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!</Page>
			<Page>In case you were hit especially hard, don’t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It’s the easiest way to visit Ol’ Spacey, too.</Page>
