		<Text>CLARY: To our friends on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>]]>: I just warped here from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>White Hole Station</color>]]> (on the other side of <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>]]>’s black hole)! Our design worked; we’ve successfully recreated warp travel!</Text>

		<Text>FILIX: This is wonderful news! I can’t wait to see the warp tower (although it’s been a long time since I’ve jumped through a black hole!).</Text>

		<Text>POKE: I don’t know how close it is to Annona’s original design, but as long as what we’ve built works, then I’m delighted! I knew we could do it (Cassava, I hope you’re reading this)!</Text>

		<Text>POKE: Wait, this can’t be correct. Clary, have you seen these readings? If they were accurate, they would violate causality. There must be an equipment error somewhere.</Text>
