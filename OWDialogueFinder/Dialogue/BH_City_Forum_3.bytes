		<Text>OENO: The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don’t have the design for such a powerful core, or any of the original crafters of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>’s core.</Text>

		<Text>CLARY: No, but Poke was apprenticed to Annona, who created the original design, and our <![CDATA[<color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color>]]> is adept at crafting simpler cores.</Text>

		<Text>POKE: I believe I can be of use here! The <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>’s warp core was created before my time, but Annona explained many of his designs to me.</Text>

		<Text>CASSAVA: Is it, though? We’ve tried for so long to find something that I (and others) now believe might be impossible to find. If the search for the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]> is a futile one, we should choose the option with the least potential for harm.</Text>

		<Text>MITIS: This is true; however, it’s knowledge we have little hope of recovering. It would be best to relearn, I think.</Text>

		<Text>POKE: I would very much like to craft such a powerful core! More relevantly, I believe the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color>]]> crew and I could recreate the basic design.</Text>
