1. ANNONA: As can be observed from this Quantum Moon locator, the moon typically wanders throughout the solar system.
2. ANNONA: However, at certain intervals, the locator is unable to tell us where the Quantum Moon is. Its indicator just spins endlessly. What does this mean?
3. Melorae: When the moon is visible, it’s always visiting a planet (one of five) in this solar system.
4. Melorae: Hypothesis: There exists a sixth planet we haven’t yet observed, and the Quantum Moon travels there.
5. COLEUS: Do you suppose this theoretical planet is hidden?
6. PYE: If it isn’t a planet we can see, it must be much farther away from the Hourglass Twins than the rest of the planets (perhaps even outside of this solar system).
7. COLEUS: Given the other places the Quantum Moon are all within this solar system, the sixth location likely lies within it, also.
8. COLEUS: I don’t imagine this is likely, but is it possible the moon briefly ceases to exist?
