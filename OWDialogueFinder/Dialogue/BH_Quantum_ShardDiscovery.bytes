			PLUME: The <![CDATA[<i>trees</i>]]> are moving! The trees in this grove wander about freely (the entire plant, roots and all)! This is <![CDATA[<i>not normal</i>]]>, even for this alien planet. And I never see them move! Is that even possible?!

			PLUME: If anyone else witnesses this disturbing behavior, I implore you, record your observations here. Either these trees are aberrant, or my brain must be!

			THATCH: Plume is right; the trees <![CDATA[<i>do</i>]]> move! I confess I didn’t notice until I read his notes.

			THATCH: Alarmingly, it isn’t only the trees: There is other matter in this area (such as that unusual shard of rock) moving in this same eerie way.

			FILIX: That rock is unusual for another reason, too, Thatch: It possesses color and texture I’ve never seen elsewhere on this planet!

			FILIX: Hypothesis: This rock shard’s presence is significant. We should study it! (Could it be what is causing other nearby objects to also move about this area?)
