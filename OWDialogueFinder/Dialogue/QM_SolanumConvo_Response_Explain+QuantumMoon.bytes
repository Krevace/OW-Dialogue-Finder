		<Text>SOLANUM: Have you encountered a quantum shard on another planet? The shards look the same as the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]>’s surface does now, while at the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]>.</Text>

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>SOLANUM: From this, we can reasonably infer the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]>’s natural state is as we see it now, and that the Eye is its primary location.</Text>

		<Text>SOLANUM: Given the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]> is the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]>’s moon, it’s likely that any characteristics the moon exhibits are also exhibited by the Eye itself. The <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]> and its shards, for instance, are quantum; thus, the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]> is likely also quantum.</Text>

		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>SOLANUM: In fact, this moon is probably quantum because its proximity to the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]> made it quantum, the same way the areas surrounding quantum shards that landed on other planets eventually became quantum, too.</Text>
