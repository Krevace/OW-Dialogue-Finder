		<Text>Who’s been computing shuttle trajectories to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]>? Don’t worry; the station is in such a low stellar orbit, we’ve constructed a different, safer way to travel there from <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>]]>.</Text>

		<Text>IDAEA: That would be Pye. I told her we wouldn’t be traveling there by <![CDATA[<color=orange>shuttle</color>]]>, and that the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]> doesn’t even have a landing pad, but she said she knew.</Text>

		<Text>PYE: It’s a purely theoretical exercise on my part, Yarrow. Who doesn’t love computing a good low stellar orbit shuttle trajectory!</Text>
