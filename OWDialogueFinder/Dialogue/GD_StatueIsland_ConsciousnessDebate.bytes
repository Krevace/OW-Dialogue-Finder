WHAT’S HAPPENING: You’re receiving memories from a future version of you that’s never going to happen.

How do we classify those memories metaphysically?

Do you actually die, considering "future" you kind of never exists/happens?

Is a person just their memories?



Is the version of you that dies and has its memories copied and sent back in time really you?


PHLOX: I’m curious: 

Because the memories are being sent back in time, and time gets rewritten, does the person who died really exist?

If you overwrite a timeline, do the events of that timeline still count?
	It’s both true that the events will ever happen, but it’s also true we have a record of them happening. (What are the ethical implications of that?)
