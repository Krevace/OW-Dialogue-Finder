FILIX: I’m recording now - I’ve never seen anything like this!\\n\\nESCALL: This is our first contact with anything of this nature. The signal the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]> is receiving appears to be older than the universe itself.\\n\\nFILIX: Shouldn’t we [tell someone where we’re going] first?\\n\\nESCALL: No, this signal will likely disappear as quickly as it appeared to us. We can send another message upon our arrival.\\n\\nFILIX: I understand! I’ll do that.\\n\\nESCALL: Annona, is the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]> ready to warp to the signal’s approximate coordinates?\\n\\nAnnona: The warp core is powered, but this will be a significant jump. Afterwards, we’ll need time to recharge the core.\\n\\nESCALL: That shouldn’t create a problem, provided we arrive at or near the signal’s source. Prepare to warp!
