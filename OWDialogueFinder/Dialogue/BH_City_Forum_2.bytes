		<Text>RAMIE: The <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>’s warp core is broken, at best (recall those present when the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]> crashed said it sustained lethal injuries). There is no guaranteed reward for this risk.</Text>

		<Text>CONOY: Perhaps we could still repair it. My grandmother told me there was little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage.</Text>

		<Text>CASSAVA: Even if it no longer functions, the old core could be a valuable blueprint, provided we’re able to transport it back here.</Text>

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>PHLOX: This would require a return to <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>]]>. Plume (my father) said many good Nomai perished there.</Text>

		<Text>CYCAD: My mentor (Coleus) and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>]]>. Using that knowledge, we could avoid the anglerfish entirely!</Text>

		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<Text>COLEUS: What Melorae and I learned from that fossil would theoretically help us evade the anglerfish, but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen.</Text>

		<Text>RAMIE: I remember that anglerfish fossil! We used to play in <![CDATA[<color=orange>Fossil Fish Cave</color>]]> when we were children.</Text>
